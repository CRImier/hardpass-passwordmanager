	My own library, slightly modifying some default parts and the ESP-12E footprint from J.Dunmire. 

(not included) FPC connector:
	https://www.snapeda.com/parts/XF2M-2015-1A-R100/Omron/view-part/
	CC-BY-SA w/ Design Exclusion
	This is probably a good connector, but I haven't tried it yet.

There are TWO PCB designs included:
	To use the default one without the ESP12E, keep the naming as it is.
	To use the one with the ESP12E footprint, rename hardpass-esp12e.kicad_pcb to hardpass-pcb.kicad_pcb
